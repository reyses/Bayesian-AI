QUANTUM STATE REFERENCE: THE UNIFIED MARKET PHYSICS
THEORIES
TARGET AUDIENCE: Claude Code (Development AI) PURPOSE: This document is the ultimate
architectural specification mapping the theoretical physics of the Bayesian-AI trading system to
the deterministic state variables and decision execution logic. Use this reference to reconnect
the quantum state computations ( bayesian_brain.py , physics_utils.py ,
fractal_dmi.py ) to the entry scoring and exit engines ( execution_engine.py ,
core/exits/* ).
1. THEORY I: THE NIGHTMARE PROTOCOL (The Gravitational Field)
The Concept: The market acts as a localized gravitational well. Price is a particle tethered to a
moving Center of Mass. The Standard Error bands define the structural integrity of this
gravitational field.
1.1 Mathematical Formalization
The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) Process: Defines the baseline mean-reverting behavior of
the particle.
The State Position (Z-Score):
Gravitational Force (
): Pulls the particle back to the mean. It strengthens linearly
as distance increases.
Boundary Repulsion Force (
): The electrostatic-like repulsion emitted by the
Event Horizon. It scales inversely with the cubed distance to the boundary ( ).
Roche Limit (
): The boundary where tidal forces begin to tear the particle's localized
trend apart.

Event Horizon (
): The absolute singularity boundary. Probability density drops to near
zero.
1.2 State Variables (Encoding the Theory)
These fields in MarketState  / ThreeBodyQuantumState  carry the protocol's state:
z_score : The spatial coordinate of the particle.
micro_velocity : The first derivative of price with respect to time (
).
F_gravity : The computed magnitude of the restoring force.
F_repulsion : The computed magnitude of the boundary pushback.
net_force : 
.
1.3 Decision Rules
ENTRY (Wave Function Collapse): Enter only when net_force  vector aligns with the
target state, and price has pulled back to a stable zone (
).
EXIT (Roche Limit Hit / Death Hook): Trigger fractal_exhaust.py  when price touches
 (Roche Limit) AND micro_velocity  flips sign (kinetic energy reaches zero against the
wall).
NO-ENTRY (Event Horizon): Hard block on any trend-continuation entries if 
.
The particle is too close to the singularity.
2. THEORY II: THE THREE-BODY PROBLEM (Fractal Chaos)
The Concept: The market consists of three interacting gravitational bodies: Macro (1h), Meso
(5m), and Micro (15s). Because a three-body system is deterministically chaotic, we must model
it probabilistically using quantum wave functions and entropy.
2.1 Mathematical Formalization
The Superposition Wave Function (
): The particle exists in a superposition of three
discrete states (Center, Upper Band, Lower Band) until observed/resolved.
Boltzmann Probabilities (
): The probability of collapsing into state , calculated via the
energy potentials of the Net Force field.

Shannon Entropy (
): Measures the chaos/uncertainty of the three-body system.
Fractal Coherence (
): The dot product (alignment) of the Micro, Meso, and Macro
directional vectors.
2.2 State Variables (Encoding the Theory)
These fields carry the quantum state:
prob_center , prob_upper , prob_lower : The collapsed Boltzmann probabilities (
).
entropy : The Shannon entropy score of the current bar.
coherence : The calculated alignment [0.0 to 1.0] of the 3 timeframes.
tunnel_probability : The Monte Carlo-derived probability of the particle tunneling
through the current resistance layer.
2.3 Decision Rules
STAY FLAT (Chaos): If entropy  is HIGH (e.g., probabilities are 
) OR
coherence  is LOW, the three bodies are in chaotic misalignment. Block all entries.
ENTER (Resolution): When entropy  drops (e.g., 
) AND coherence  is
HIGH, the 3-body system has temporarily resolved into a stable orbit. Execute trade in the
direction of the highest probability state.
EXIT (Decoherence): Trigger regime_decay.py  if a previously high coherence  state
rapidly decays into high entropy  while a trade is open.
3. THEORY III: THE RESONANCE CASCADE (The Alpha Event)
The Concept: Occasionally, the frequencies of the Three Bodies synchronize. The Micro particle
does not bounce off the Meso Roche Limit; it resonates with the Macro gravity. The standard
statistical boundaries shatter, resulting in violent, exponential directional expansion (a Black
Swan / Trend Day).
3.1 Mathematical Formalization
The Lyapunov Exponent ( ): Measures the rate of separation of infinitesimally close
trajectories. Determines if the system is stable (
) or chaotic/cascading (
).

Hurst Exponent (
): Measures the long-term memory of the series.
: Mean-reverting (Stable)
: Persistent (Resonance Cascade)
3.2 State Variables (Encoding the Theory)
lyapunov_exponent : Real-time calculation of .
macro_hurst_exponent : Rolling Hurst calculation on the Macro timeframe.
is_resonance_cascade : Boolean flag. True  if 
 and 
.
3.3 Decision Rules
HOLD (Cascade Active): If is_resonance_cascade == True , standard physics are
suspended. Do not fade the edges.
EXIT (Cascade Exhaustion): Exit cascade mode only when 
 decays below 
 or  flips
negative.
4. THE CASCADE MODE PROTOCOL
When the system detects a true market anomaly, it enters a dedicated execution protocol
designed to capture maximum asymmetric upside.
Exact Conditions ( is_resonance_cascade = True ):
1. 
macro_hurst_exponent
2. 
lyapunov_exponent
3. 
coherence  is near 
 (Macro, Meso, and Micro DMI/ADX vectors perfectly aligned).
4. Macro Volatility (
) is expanding directionally.
Suppressed Exits (During Cascade):
Standard Take Profit: Disabled. We do not cap gains during a cascade.
Band Exit / Roche Limit Defense: Disabled. The 
 and 
 bands are actively breaking;
fading them is mathematically fatal.
Cascade Termination Triggers:
Regime Decay ( regime_decay.py ): The macro_hurst_exponent  drops below 
,
signaling a return to mean-reversion physics.
Tidal Wave ( tidal_wave.py ): Volatility suddenly expands violently in the opposite
direction of the cascade.
Vector Collapse: Macro ADX hooks downward violently.
