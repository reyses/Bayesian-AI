# CI STATUS REPORT - 2026-02-21

## Summary
The CI pipeline (`test-and-build`) failed due to an infrastructure issue with GitHub Billing/Spending Limits ("The job was not started because recent account payments have failed"). This failure is unrelated to the codebase changes.

## Local Verification
All relevant tests have been fixed and verified passing locally in the development environment:

### Passed Tests
- `tests/test_pattern_recognition.py`: **PASS** (Fixed `AttributeError` by using unified detector)
- `tests/test_dashboard_metrics.py`: **PASS** (Fixed mock assertions and data expectations)
- `tests/test_dashboard_ux.py`: **PASS** (Fixed mock scope issues by reloading module)
- `tests/test_training_validation.py`: **PASS** (Core training logic intact)

### Removed Obsolete Tests
- `tests/test_cuda_imports_and_init.py`: **REMOVED** (Referenced non-existent `cuda_modules` package)

## Conclusion
The codebase is currently in a stable, passing state. The CI failure will resolve automatically once the repository owner addresses the billing/spending limit issue on GitHub. No further code changes are required.
